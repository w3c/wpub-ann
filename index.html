				<h3>Handling Undefined JSON Properties</h3>
				<p>
					This specification relies on a subset of JSON terms originally defined as part of the Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[!annotation-model]] and Vocabulary&nbsp;[[!annotation-vocab]]. 
					This specification extends the definitions of some of these terms and 
					defines additional terms in order to satisfy additional use cases, but all uses conforming to original definitions remain valid.
					In order to ensure backward compatibility, implementations of this specification MAY ignore any JSON terms not defined in this specification 
					(directly or by reference to the Web Annotation Data Model and Vocabulary) and MUST NOT treat as invalid any JSON term encountered that is not defined in this specification.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance requirements related to specific selectors</h3>
				<p>
					Not all Selectors defined in this specification are relevant for all resource media types.
					A conforming implementation MAY therefore ignore a certain type of Selector when the corresponding media type(s) associated
					with the Selector are not handled by that particular implementation.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<section>
				<h3>The Web Annotation Selection Model</h3>
				<p>
					Selecting a <em>part of</em> a resource on the Web is an ubiquitous action. Similarly, 
					referencing a <em>position in</em> 
					a resource representation is often necessary to support curation of and  discourse about Web resources. 
					Interactive editing of a resource, highlighting an area on the screen, adding an annotation to a specific point 
					in a resource, or defining a bookmark to a location or a section of a long document are all examples that 
					involve selection or positioning within a resource.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Over the years several techniques for selection have been developed, usually in conjunction with the media type of the resource.
					These include referring to a unique identifier within a resource, defining a time interval for an audio or video track, 
					identifying an element within the DOM tree for an XML source, or using CSS style elements to locate and select content.
					Often these selections are expressed as <em>fragment identifiers</em>&nbsp;[[url]], but that is not always the case.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					This document relies on a selection technique defined by the Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[!annotation-model]] providing a <em>common model and syntax</em> for such selections. 
					That specification developed a formalism based on JSON&nbsp;[[json]] to select targets or bodies of various types of Web Resources. 
					The model relies on the concepts of <em><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#selectors">Selectors</a></em>, encapsulating in a JSON object the various ways selections have been defined for different media types, and <em><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#stated">States</a></em>, encapsulating selections based on HTTP requests and responses.
					The model also includes a way to <em>combine</em> and/or <em>refine</em> selections, a feature that may greatly improve the efficiency of applications relying on complex selections. 
					A selection or a state <em>specifier</em>, as described in the original model and used in this document, may also have its own unique identity in the form of an URL.
					This URL SHOULD be dereferencable and return the selection/state specifier definition itself.
				</p>
	
				<p class="note">
					Using the URL of the selection definition, instead of the reference to the “complete” resource could be seen as akin to a server side redirection, returning part of a resource.
				</p>
				
				<p class="note">
					The Web Annotation Working Group has also published a separate Working Group Note entitled “Selectors and States”&nbsp;[[selectors-states]]. 
					That note extracts the selector model from the full Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[annotation-model]] to make it more palatable for users who are not necessarily interested in other aspects of the Annotation Model.
					Although normatively this specification refers to the [[!annotation-model]], readers should probably consult the [[selectors-states]] note for a better understanding of the underlying concepts. Note, however, that the [[selectors-states]] Working Group Note also includes a proposal for a fragment identifier syntax; that syntax has not been used in the current specification.
				</p>

				<h4>Examples</h4>

				<p>The example below shows the usage of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#text-quote-selector">Text Quote Selector</a> referring to a specific portion of text in a resource:</p>

				<pre class="example highlight" title="Text Quote Selector" id="TextQuoteSelector_ex">
{
  "source": "http://example.org/page1",
  "selector": {
    "type": "TextQuoteSelector",
    "exact": "annotation",
    "prefix": "this is an ",
    "suffix": " that has some"
  }
}
</pre>

				<p>The next example shows the usage of refinement: specific portion of text is selected from a paragraph; the latter is identified via a “traditional” fragment identification.</p>
        		<pre class="example highlight" title="Selector Refinement" id="SelectorRefinement_ex">
{
  "source": "http://example.org/page1",
  "selector": {
    "type": "FragmentSelector",
    "value": "para5",
    "refinedBy": {
      "type": "TextQuoteSelector",
      "exact": "Selected Text",
      "prefix": "text before the ",
      "suffix": " and text after it"
    }
  }
}</pre>

				<p class=note>
					See the [[selectors-states]] Note for more examples for the usage of the Web Annotation Model for selection.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Extensions of the Web Annotation Approach</h3>

				<p>
					The approach defined by the [[annotation-model]] has been extended in this specification by adding selector types applicable to collective resources and a new model component for describing positions in text and byte streams. 
					It provides methods for selecting a segment of a collective resource (e.g., a “Web Publication”&nbsp;[[wpub]])
					that itself <em>contains</em> or is <em>composed of</em> other discrete and individually identifiable resources, 
					even when the segment of interest spans parts of more than one included resource. 
					The common model for selection as described in this specification makes it easier to provide generic and interoperable tools and APIs to handle selections in various applications.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					More specifically, this document extends the Web Annotation Data Model by <em>adding</em> three new selectors, namely:
				</p>
	
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selectors</a> can be used to select a full resource from a collection or group of resources collectively identified with a URL;</li>
					<li>Embedded Resource Selectors can also be <a href="#ErsFragmentId_def">serialized as Fragment Identifiers</a></li>
					<li><a href="#SpanSelector_def">Span Selectors</a> identify a selection spanning two or more consecutive resources in an ordered group or collection of resources, e.g, a “Web Publication”&nbsp;[[wpub]].</li>
					<li><a href="#MultiResourceSelector_def">Multi Resource Selectors</a> identify a collection of discrete selections, whether within the same resource or spread over several resources.</li>
				</ul>
	
				<p>
					These changes aim at addressing the particular requirements of resource collections on the Web, like Web Applications or Web Publications&nbsp;[[wpub]].
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Additionally the current document augments the Web Annotation Data Model of selectors and states with a new class of specifier, <a data-lt="Position">Positions</a>. Two position specifiers are defined:
				</p>
				
					<ul>
					<li><a href="#TextStreamPosition_def">Text Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a text stream representation of a resource.</li>
					<li><a href="#DataStreamPosition_def">Data Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a byte stream representation of a resource.</li>
				</ul>
	
				<p>Although defined in conjunction with Web Publications, the techniques described in this document can be used for any type of 
					Web Resource.

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p><em>This section is normative</em></p>
				
				<p>
					Wherever appropriate, this document relies on terminology defined by the note on “Publishing and Linking on the Web”&nbsp;[[!publishing-linking]], including, in particular, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user">user</a>, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-user-agent">user agent</a>, <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-browser">browser</a>, and <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-address">address</a>.
					Furthermore, the document also relies on some additional terms defined by the “Web Publication”&nbsp;[[wpub]], including a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/Overview.html#dfn-url" class="externalDFN">URL</a>.
				</p>
			
                <dl>
					<dt><dfn data-lt="Resource|Resources">Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd>An item of interest that MAY be identified by a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/Overview.html#dfn-url">URL</a>.</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Resource|Web Resources">Web Resource</dfn></dt>
					<dd>A <a>Resource</a> that MUST be identified by a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/Overview.html#dfn-url">URL</a>, as described in the Web Architecture [[webarch]]. Web Resources MAY be dereferencable via their URL.</dd>

					<dt><dfn>Locator</dfn></dt>
					<dd>A <a>Resource</a> that specifies a position in or a portion of another <a>Web Resource</a>. A Locator expresses its relationship to the relevant Web Resource (the <a>Source</a>) through a <code>source</code> term, and MAY express a contextual relationship to an additional <a>Web Resource</a> through a <code>scope</code> term. The original [[!annotation-model]] document used the term <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#specific-resources" class="externalDFN">Specific Resource</a> as a generic term encompassing usages that go beyond selection. This specification uses the term “Locator” as an alias.
					 </dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Property|Properties">Property</dfn></dt>
					<dd>A feature of a <a>Resource</a>, that often has a particular data type.  In the model sections, the term “Property” is used to refer to only those features which are <em>not</em> <a>Relationships</a> and instead have a literal value such as a string, integer, or date.  The valid values for a Property are thus any data type other than object, or an array containing members of that data type if more than one is allowed.</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="Relationship|Relationships">Relationship</dfn></dt>
					<dd>In the model sections, the term “Relationship” is used to distinguish those features that refer to other <a>Resources</a>, either by reference to the <a>Resource</a>'s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/Overview.html#dfn-url">URL</a> or by including a description of the <a>Resource</a> in the representation. The valid values for a Relationship are: a quoted string containing a URL, an object that has the “id” property, or an array containing either of these if more than one is allowed.</dd>

					<dt><dfn data-lt="type|types|typing">Type</dfn></dt>
                	<dd>A feature of a <a>Resource</a> whose valid values are predefined strings (defined in this document) denoting the particular type of <a data-lt="Selector">Selector</a>, <a data-lt="Position">Position</a>, or <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#states">State</a> specifier.</dd>

				<h3>Embedded Resource Selector</h3>

				<p><em>This section is normative</em></p>

				<p>
					For some use cases it is required to identify a resource that is part of a collection or group of resources, 
					where that collection has its own identity on the Web (and can be identified via its own URL). 
					An example is selecting a resource that is a chapter of a Web Publication [[!wpub]] or Packaged Web Publication&nbsp;[[!pwpub]].
					Given the URL of such a collective resource as the value of <code>source</code>, an Embedded Resource 
					Selector can be used to select and identify an item within the collection, e.g., the chapter, through 
					its <code>value</code> relationship.
					This Selector is usually used in conjunction with additional Selectors, e.g., through 
					<a href="#SelectorRefinement_def">refinement</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Janine wants to select the cover image of a Web Publication, which is linked to the Web Publication as a whole.
					She uses an Embedded Resource Selector to designate the image, with the Web Publication’s address as the <a>Source</a> for the selector.

					A frequent usage of refinement is in combination with an <a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selector</a> to denote the fact that a particular selection is related to, e.g., a Web Publication.

					Note the usage of a relative URL in the example; it is considered to be good practice to use relative URL, when applicable.

				<p class="note">
					For such a simple case, the usage of <code>scope</code> provides for a more succinct way of expressing the same information, see <a href="#scope_example">the example for a CSS Selector</a>.

						This assumes WPs and/or PWPs will have their own media type. 
						If the group decides to define a media type for PWPub (and/or WPub) resources, 
						this section will remain in the document and the examples and illustrations may be updated using file extension associated with new media type(s), i.e., the .wpub file extension below is a placeholder.

					<p>
						For some simple use cases involving collective resources (of a registered collective resource media type), e.g., Packaged Web Publications, it may be more convenient or more consistent with past practice to express a simple Embedded Resource selection as a fragment identifier&nbsp;[[url]] that can be appended to the url of the collective resource, i.e., the <code>source</code> associated with the Embedded Resource selection. 
						(An informative precedent for this approach is the International Digital Publishing Forum  Recommended Specification, <em>EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifiers 1.1</em>&nbsp;[[cfi]], which defines a fragment identifier serialized model for selecting and positioning	within resources of the <code>application/epub+zip</code> media type.) 
					</p>
        		
        			<p>
						A mapping for serializing simple Embedded Resource selections as fragment identifiers is defined below.	
						This mapping allows the <a>Segment (of interest)</a> to be expressed in a single URL. 
						Note that this representation is valid only if the URL for the <a>Source</a> (the collective resource) does not itself already include a fragment identifier of its own.
					 </p>
					 
					<p>
						An Embedded Resource Selector is serialized as a fragment identifier using a function-like syntax, i.e.: 
					</p>
        		
					<ul>
						<li>The <code>source</code> for the selection is the base URL to which a <code>#</code> character is appended.</li>
						<li>Next comes the fixed string <code>ERS</code> (in lieu of a function name), followed by a single 'parameter' enclosed in parentheses.</li>
						<li>
							The single 'parameter' of the function-like notation is a URL&nbsp;[[!url]], i.e., the <code>value</code> from the JSON serialization of the Embedded Resource Selector. 
							The parameter MAY be and absolute URL or relative to the base URL.
						</li>
					</ul>

        			<p>
						The value of the URL 'parameter' appearing in a ERS fragment identifier SHOULD be percent encoded&nbsp;[[!rfc3986]]. 
						The encoding is a MUST for characters that may make the URL ambiguous, namely:

				<h3>Span Selector</h3>

				<p><em>This section is normative</em></p>
				
				<p>
					Selections from a group of resources, e.g., the group of resources which comprise a Web Publication&nbsp;[[!wpub]]), may be extensive 
					and may span member resource boundaries. For resource-spanning selections that are continuous in some ordering of the group of resources, a
					Span Selector can be used to identify the beginning and the end of the selection using <a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource
					Selectors</a>, refined as appropriate. Embedded Resource Selectors (without refinement) are also used in enumerating any intervening resources between the beginning and end of the
					selection that are included in the selection. 
					A Span Selection MUST span at least two resources. (For continuous selections wholly contained within a single
					resource, use a <a href="#RangeSelector_def">Range Selector</a>.) 
					In the absence of refinement, the selection consists of the member resource identified by the <code>startSelector</code> property
					(the first resource in the selection), the member resource identified by the <code>endSelector</code> (the last resource
					in the selection), and the intervening member resource(s) (in some ordering of the group) between the starting and ending member resources
					as enumerated by the <code>selectors</code> property. 
					If the <code>startSelector</code> is refined with another selector, then only the part of the first resource from the 
					start of the refined selection to that resource's end (i.e., including what is identified by refinement)
					is included in the span selection. If the <code>endSelector</code> is refined with another selector, then only the part of the 
					last resource prior to the start of the refined selection (i.e., excluding what is identified by refinement) 
					is included in the selection.
				</p>

				<p class=note>The ordering of resources does <em>not</em> make use of external features, like the default reading order in a Web Publication&nbsp;[[wpub]]. The order is exclusively established via the <code>selectors</code> property.</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Misha wants to comment on text in a Web Publication that spreads over <em>several constituent resources</em>.
					He selects the start and the end of the selection in different of those resources; his User Agent calculates the Span Selector using a 
					series of Embedded Resource Selections from the first selection as a start and the last selector as the end to provide a continuous span.

				<h3>Text Stream Position</h3>
				
				<p>
					The <dfn>TextStreamPosition</dfn> specifier describes an inter-character position in a text stream by recording the 
					number of characters that precede the position. 
					The property <code>value</code> is used to record this character count. 
				  	A <code>value</code> of 0 would describe the position immediately before the first character, a <code>value</code> of 1 would describe the position immediately after the first character and before the second character (i.e., the position between the first two characters of the stream), and so on. 
					For example, if the text stream was “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” and the <code>value</code> was 7, then the position referenced would be the position between "g" and "h". If n is the length of the text stream, then a <code>value</code> equal to n denotes the position immediately	following the last character in the text stream. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In some situations, it is important to preserve which side of a position a location reference points to. 
					For example, when resolving a text stream position in a dynamically paginated environment, it could make a difference if a position is attached to the content before or after the location being referenced (e.g., to determine whether to display the verso or recto side at a page break). 
					In a <code>TextStreamPosition</code> object, the <code>bias</code> property MAY be used to attach a position reference to the character preceding the position identified by the <code>value</code> property (<code>"bias": "before"</code>) or to the character following the position (<code>"bias": "after"</code>). 
					For example, if the text stream was “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz”, the <code>value</code> was 7, and the <code>bias</code> was <code>before</code>, then the position referenced would be the position between "g" and "h" and would be attached to "g".	
				</p>
				
				<p class="note">
					The property <code>bias</code> is only meaningful when some type of break (e.g., a page break or line break) falls or might fall at the position specified by the TextStreamPosition specifier.
				</p>				
				
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> George notices that a letter is missing between characters 322 and 323 in the text of an HTML file he is reading and decides he wants to mark the position of the missing letter by generating a TextStreamPosition specifier so that the letter can be inserted later during editing. 
					He also wants to ensure that if a hyphen and line break should be dynamically inserted in this position the missing character would follow the break, and so he uses the bias property to associate the position reference with the character that follows the position being referenced (i.e., character 323).
				</p>
								
				<p class="ednote">
					Is this a valid example as regards bias? 
					Or is this kind of situation better handled by an application rather than conflating a side-bias property with the position reference.
					If not compelling enough, we need a better more concrete, real-world use case for side-bias!
					Otherwise we should drop side-bias.

					Similar to the <a>TextStreamPosition</a> specifier, the <dfn>DataStreamPosition</dfn> specifier describes a position between two bytes in a byte stream representation of a resource by recording the number of bytes that precede the position.

				<h3>Using Position to Refine</h3>
				
				<p>
					Unlike <a>Selector</a> and <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#states">State</a> specifiers, a <a>Position</a> specifier can not be refined (since it identifies a point in a stream rather than a part of a resource or a representation of a resource). 
					However, it may be easier, more reliable, more accurate, or less brittle to resolve a Position specifier in the context of a part of a resource defined by a <a>Selector</a> and/or a representation of a resource described by a <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#states">State</a>. 
					Thus a Position specifier may be used to refine a Selector or State (including refined Selectors or States), as long as the Position specifier is the final refinement step processed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Deren is one of several people who are collaboratively editing an HTML file. 
					He needs to generate a TextStreamPosition specifier identifying a position where the word "Mister" needs to be inserted in one of the paragraphs he alone has been assigned to edit. 
					He doesn't want to specify a text character count within the text stream representation of the entire HTML file, since he knows other edits are in progress that could affect that character count. 
					So instead he uses a <a href="#CssSelector_def">CssSelector</a> to select the paragraph of interest and then refines this selection with a <a>TextStreamPosition</a> specifier to reference the position within the paragraph where the insertion is needed.

				<h4>Changes Relative to the Web Annotation Model</h4>

				<p><strong>Editorial Changes</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All references to RDF and JSON-LD have been removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						The term <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/#specific-resources" class="externalDFN">“Specific Resource”</a> has been changed to <a>Locator</a>. (This is just an alias to “Specific Resource”, hence does not change the original semantics.)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Non-editorial Changes</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Three new Selectors have been added, namely
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selectors</a> can be used to select a full resource, with its a, from a collection of resources, also identified with a URL;</li>
							<li><a href="#SpanSelector_def">Span Selectors</a> identify a continuous selection that spans multiple embedded resources in some ordered reading of a collection or group of resources identified with a URL.</li>
							<li><a href="#MultipleResourceSelector_def">Multiple Resource Selectors</a> identify a ordered list of discrete selections, whether within a single resource or spread over multiple embedded resources included in a collection or group of resources identified with a URL
					</li>

					<li>A new kind of specifier, the <a>Position</a> specifier, has been added. Two Position specifier types have been added: 
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#TextStreamPosition_def">Text Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a text stream representation of a resource.</li>
							<li><a href="#DataStreamPosition_def">Data Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a byte stream representation of a resource.</li>
						</ul>					
					</li>

			<h3>Relationships to the Web Annotation Model</h3>
