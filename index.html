            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
            	Selecting a <em>part of</em> a resource on the Web is an ubiquitous action. Similarly, 
            	referencing a <em>position in</em> 
            	a resource representation is often necessary to support curation of and  discourse about Web resources. 
				Interactive editing of a resource, highlighting an area on the screen, adding an annotation to a specific point 
				in a resource, or defining a bookmark to a location or a section of a long document are all examples that 
				involve selection or positioning within a resource.</p>
        	<p>
				Over the years several techniques for selection have been developed, usually in conjunction with the media type of the resource.
				These include referring to a unique identifier within a resource, defining a time interval for an audio or video track, 
				identifying an element within the DOM tree for an XML source, or using CSS style elements to locate and select content.
				Often these selections are expressed as <em>fragment identifiers</em>&nbsp;[[url]], but that is not always the case.
			</p>

            <p>
            	This specification relies primarily on existing selection techniques, providing a <em>common model and syntax</em> to express
            	selections (i.e., using <em>selector</em> objects).
							Furthermore, the model also includes a way to <em>combine</em> and/or <em>refine</em> selections, 
            	a feature that may greatly improve the efficiency of applications relying on complex selections. This specification
            	also models objects (<em>position</em> and <em>state</em>) supporting two additional curation and use tasks, 
            	thereby extending the selection model with ways to   
            	express the information needed to retrieve a desired representation of a resource and/or to identify 
            	a precise location in the text stream or byte stream of a resource representation.
            	Lastly, the model also provides methods for selecting a segment of a collective resource (e.g., a “Web Publication”&nbsp;[[wpub]])
            	that itself <em>contains</em> or is <em>composed of</em> other discrete and individually identifiable resources, 
            	even when the segment of interest spans parts of more than one included resource. 
				The common model for selection as described in this specification makes it easier to provide generic and interoperable tools and APIs to handle selections in various applications.
			</p>

            <p>
				A selection, position, or state <em>specifier</em>, as described in this document, may have its own unique identity 
				in the form of an URL.
				This URL SHOULD be dereferencable and return the selection/position/state specifier definition itself.
			</p>

            <p class="note">
				Using the URL of the selection definition, instead of the reference to the “complete” resource could be seen 
				as akin to a server side redirection, returning part of a resource.
            </p>

            <p>
				The data model is defined in [[json]], in the form of JSON objects and keys.
				The formal specification and the semantics of these objects and keys originate from a larger model, namely the 
				Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[!annotation-model]], where it is used to select targets and bodies of annotations.
				The current document “extracts” <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> from that data model; 
        by doing so, it makes their usage easier for application developers whose concerns are not related to annotations. 
				Compared to the Web Annotation Data Model, however, this document does <em>add</em> three new selectors, namely:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selectors</a> can be used to select a full resource from a collection or group of resources collectively identified with a URL;</li>
				<li>Embedded Resource Selectors can also be <a href="#ErsFragmentId_def">serialized as Fragment Identifiers</a></li>
				<li><a href="#SpanSelector_def">Span Selectors</a> identify a selection spanning two or more consecutive resources in an ordered group or collection of resources, e.g, a “Web Publication”&nbsp;[[wpub]].</li>
				<li><a href="#MultiResourceSelector_def">Multi Resource Selectors</a> identify a collection of discrete selections, whether within the same resource or spread over several resources.</li>
			</ul>

        	<p>
				These changes aim at addressing the particular requirements of resource collections on the Web, like Web Applications or Web Publications&nbsp;[[wpub]].
			</p>
        	
        	<p>
        		Additionally the current document augments the Web Annotation Data Model of selectors and states with a new class of specifier, <a data-lt="Position">Positions</a>. Two position specifiers are defined:
        	</p>
        	
     		<ul>
				<li><a href="#TextStreamPosition_def">Text Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a text stream representation of a resource.</li>
				<li><a href="#ByteStreamPosition_def">Byte Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a byte stream representation of a resource.</li>
			</ul>
        	<p>Although defined in conjunction with Web Publications, the techniques described in this document can be used for any type of 
        		Web Resource.

            <p>Selection of part of a <a>Web Resource</a> requires two distinct entities:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                	the <a href=" https://w3c.github.io/wpub/index.html#dfn-url">URL</a> of the overall resource; we will refer to this as the <a>Source</a> (see <a>Locator</a>).

					the identification for the part of that resource; we will refer to this as the <a data-lt="segment">Segment (of Interest)</a>.
				</li>

            <p>
				A <dfn data-lt="Selectors">Selector</dfn> specifies how to determine the <a>Segment</a> from within the <a>Source</a> resource.
				The nature of the Selector is dependent on the selection technique chosen (which determines the class of the Selector) and the media-type of the Source, as the methods to describe Segments from various media-types differ. 
				The Source and the Selector(s) are encapsulated in a <a>Locator</a>.

                <p>
					As the most well understood mechanism for selecting a <a>Segment</a> is to resolve the fragment identifier part of a URL as defined by the representation’s media type, it is useful to allow fragments as a description mechanism via a Selector.
					This allows existing and future fragment identifier specifications to be used with Locators in a consistent way.
					To be clear about which fragment identifier type is being used, the <a>Selector</a> SHOULD refer to the specification that defines the fragment identifier type.
				</p>

                <p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Ramona wants to associate part of a video as the description of an image.
					She selects the time range within the video and clicks that it is describing the target.

					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Sally selects a paragraph in a one of the chapters of a Web Publication that she wishes bookmark.  
					Her client calculates a CSS path that cleanly identifies that element and stores CSS Selector in its local bookmark store.
					Because the selection is made as part of a Web Publication (e.g., through the WP aware User Agent), a reference to the Web Publication’s address is also added to the bookmark.

					If the content is under copyright or has other rights asserted on its use, then this method of selecting text is potentially dangerous.

				<h3>Embedded Resource Selector</h3>

				<p><em>This section is normative</em></p>

				<p>
					For some use cases it is required to identify a resource that is part of a collection or group of resources, 
					where that collection has its own identity on the Web (and can be identified via its own URL). 
					An example is selecting a resource that is a chapter of a Web Publication [[!wpub]] or Packaged Web Publication&nbsp;[[!pwpub]].
					Given the URL of such a collective resource as the value of <code>source</code>, an Embedded Resource 
					Selector can be used to select and identify an item within the collection, e.g., the chapter, through 
					its <code>value</code> relationship.
					This Selector is usually used in conjunction with additional Selectors, e.g., through 
					<a href="#SelectorRefinement_def">refinement</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Janine wants to select the cover image of a Web Publication, which is linked to the Web Publication as a whole.
					She uses an Embedded Resource Selector to designate the image, with the Web Publication’s address as the <a>Source</a> for the selector.

				<p>
					A frequent usage of refinement is in combination with an <a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selector</a> to denote the fact that a particular selection is related to, e.g., a Web Publication.
					For example:
				</p> 

				<pre class="example highlight" title="Refined Embedded Resource Selector" id="RefinedEmbeddedResourceSelector_ex">
{
  "source": "https://dauwhe.github.io/html-first/MobyDick.wpub",

    "refinedBy": {
      "type": "CssSelector",
      "value": "#elemid > .elemclass + p"
    }		
  }
}	</pre>

				<p>
					Note the usage of a relative URL in the example; it is considered to be good practice to use relative URL, when applicable.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					For such a simple case, the usage of <code>scope</code> provides for a more succinct way of expressing the same information, see <a href="#scope_example">the example for a CSS Selector</a>. However, when combined with other selectors like, for example, a <a href="#SpanSelector_def">Span Selector</a>, the usage of this pattern becomes essential.

					<p class="ednote">
						This assumes WPs and/or PWPs will have their own media type.

					<p class="issue" data-number="6"></p>
					
					<p>
						For some simple use cases involving collective resources (of a registered collective resource media type), e.g., Packaged Web Publications, it may be more convenient or more consistent with past practice to express a simple Embedded Resource selection as a fragment identifier&nbsp;[[url]] that can be appended to the url of the collective resource, i.e., the <code>source</code> associated with the Embedded Resource selection. 
						(An informative precedent for this approach is the International Digital Publishing Forum  Recommended Specification, <em>EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifiers 1.1</em>&nbsp;[[cfi]], which defines a fragment identifer serialized model for selecting and positioning	within resources of the	<code>application/epub+zip</code> media type.) 
					</p>
        		
        			<p>
						A mapping for serializing simple Embedded Resource selections as fragment identifiers is defined below.	
						This mapping allows the <a>Segment (of interest)</a> to be expressed in a single URL. 
						Note that this representation is valid only if the URL for the <a>Source</a> (the collective resource) does not itself already include a fragment identifier of its own.
					 </p>
					 
					<p>
						An Embedded Resource Selector is serialized as a fragment identifier using a function-like syntax, i.e.: 
					</p>
        		
					<ul>
						<li>The <code>source</code> for the selection is the base URL to which a <code>#</code> character is appended.</li>
						<li>Next comes the fixed string <code>ERS</code> (in lieu of a function name), followed by a single 'parameter' enclosed in parentheses.</li>
						<li>
							The single 'parameter' of the function-like notation is a URL, i.e., the <code>value</code> from the JSON serialization of the Embedded Resource Selector. 
							The parameter MAY be and absolute URL or relative to the base URL.
						</li>
					</ul>

        			<p>
						The value of the URL 'parameter' appearing in a ERS fragment identifier SHOULD be percent encoded&nbsp;[[rfc3986]]. 
						The encoding is a MUST for characters that may make the URL ambiguous, namely:
        			</p>

        				Until such a registration is done, these fragment identifiers have the potential to conflict with other fragment identifier schemes specified by media type registrations.

				<h3>Span Selector</h3>

				<p><em>This section is normative</em></p>
				
				<p>
					Selections from a group of resources, e.g., the group of resources which comprise a Web Publication&nbsp;[[!wpub]]), may be extensive 
					and may span member resource boundaries. For resource-spanning selections that are continuous in some ordering of the group of resources, a
					Span Selector can be used to identify the beginning and the end of the selection using <a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource
					Selectors</a>, refined as appropriate. Embedded Resource Selectors (without refinement) are also used in enumerating any intervening resources between the beginning and end of the
					selection that are included in the selection. 
					A Span Selection MUST span at least two resources. (For continuous selections wholly contained within a single
					resource, use a <a href="#RangeSelector_def">Range Selector</a>.) 
					In the absence of refinement, the selection consists of the member resource identified by the <code>startSelector</code> property
					(the first resource in the selection), the member resource identified by the <code>endSelector</code> (the last resource
					in the selection), and the intervening member resource(s) (in some ordering of the group) between the starting and ending member resources
					as enumerated by the <code>selectors</code> property. 
					If the <code>startSelector</code> is refined with another selector, then only the part of the first resource from the 
					start of the refined selection to that resource's end (i.e., including what is identified by refinement)
					is included in the span selection. If the <code>endSelector</code> is refined with another selector, then only the part of the 
					last resource prior to the start of the refined selection (i.e., excluding what is identified by refinement) 
					is included in the selection.

					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Misha wants to comment on text in a Web Publication that spreads over <em>several constituent resources</em>.
					He selects the start and the end of the selection in different of those resources; his User Agent calculates the Span Selector using a 
					series of Embedded Resource Selections from the first selection as a start and the last selector as the end to provide a continuous span.

				<h3>Request Header State</h3>

					As there are potentially many representations that can be delivered from a resource with a single URL, and a selection may only apply to one of them, it is important to be able to record the HTTP Request headers that need to be sent to retrieve the correct representation.  
					The HttpRequestState resource maintains a copy of the headers to be replayed when obtaining the representation.

				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Carla retrieves a PDF representation of a Web resource that can deliver HTML, PDF or plain text and then writes a description about it.

				<h3>Refinement of State</h3>
				
				<p>
					Similar to the <a href="#SelectorRefinement_def">refinement of selection</a>, it may be easier, more reliable or more accurate to specify the appropriate state of the resource as a hierarchy of atomic <a>State</a> resources.
					This is particularly appropriate for representing the combination of a <a>State</a> that reflects an internal transformation along with the results of a State that describes an external request.
					This decomposition is accomplished by having the states chained together in the same way as Selectors.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Further, given that the State(s) will likely result in a specific representation, there may be specific <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> that are appropriate for describing the <a>segment</a> of the representation.
					In order to accommodate this, States may also be refined by <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Devina writes a comment about a travel e-book which has many versions available over time, and is available in different formats.

				<h3>Text Stream Position</h3>
				
				<p>
					The <dfn>TextStreamPosition</dfn> specifier describes an inter-character position in a text stream by recording the 
					number of characters that precede the position. 
					The property <code>value</code> is used to record this character count. 
				  	A <code>value</code> of 0 would describe the position immediately before the first character, a <code>value</code> of 1 would describe the position immediately after the first character and before the second character (i.e., the position between the first two characters of the stream), and so on. 
					For example, if the text stream was “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” and the <code>value</code> was 7, then the position referenced would be the position between "g" and "h". If n is the length of the text stream, then a <code>value</code> equal to n denotes the position immediately	following the last character in the text stream. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In some situations, it is important to preserve which side of a position a location reference points to. 
					For example, when resolving a text stream position in a dynamically paginated environment, it could make a difference if a position is attached to the content before or after the location being referenced (e.g., to determine whether to display the verso or recto side at a page break). 
					In a <code>TextStreamPosition</code> object, the <code>bias</code> property MAY be used to attach a position reference to the character preceding the position identified by the <code>value</code> property (<code>"bias": "before"</code>) or to the character following the position (<code>"bias": "after"</code>). 
					For example, if the text stream was “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz”, the <code>value</code> was 7, and the <code>bias</code> was <code>before</code>, then the position referenced would be the position between "g" and "h" and would be attached to "g".	
				</p>
				
				<p class="note">
					The property <code>bias</code> is only meaningful when some type of break (e.g., a page break or line break) falls or might fall at the position specified by the TextStreamPosition specifier.
				</p>				
				
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> George notices that a letter is missing between characters 322 and 323 in the text of an HTML file he is reading and decides he wants to mark the position of the missing letter by generating a TextStreamPosition specifier so that the letter can be inserted later during editing. 
					He also wants to ensure that if a hyphen and line break should be dynamically inserted in this position the missing character would follow the break, and so he uses the bias property to associate the position reference with the character that follows the position being referenced (i.e., character 323).
				</p>
								
				<p class="ednote">
					Is this a valid example as regards bias? 
					Or is this kind of situation better handled by an application rather than conflating a side-bias property with the position reference.
					If not compelling enough, we need a better more concrete, real-world use case for side-bias!
					Otherwise we should drop side-bias.

				<h3>Data Stream Position</h3>

					Similar to the <a>TextStreamPosition</a> specifier, the <dfn>DataStreamPosition</dfn> specifier describes a position between two bytes in a byte stream representation of a resource by recording the number of bytes that precede the position.

					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Paul's data processing application fails after processing the first 401 bytes of a resource's byte stream representation.

				<h3>Using Position to Refine</h3>
				
				<p>
					Unlike <a>Selector</a> and <a>State</a> specifiers, a <a>Position</a> specifier can not be refined (since it identifies a point in a stream rather than a part of a resource or a representation of a resource). 
					However, it may be easier, more reliable, more accurate, or less brittle to resolve a Position specifier in the context of a part of a resource defined by a <a>Selector</a> and/or a representation of a resource described by a <a>State</a>. 
					Thus a Position specifier may be used to refine a Selector or State (including refined Selectors or States), as long as the Position specifier is the final refinement step processed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Example Use Case:</b> Deren is one of several people who are collaboratively editing an HTML file. 
					He needs to generate a TextStreamPosition specifier identifying a position where the word "Mister" needs to be inserted in one of the paragraphs he alone has been assigned to edit. 
					He doesn't want to specify a text character count within the text stream representation of the entire HTML file, since he knows other edits are in progress that could affect that character count. 
					So instead he uses a <a href="#CssSelector_def">CssSelector</a> to select the paragraph of interest and then refines this selection with a <a>TextStreamPosition</a> specifier to reference the position within the paragraph where the insertion is needed.

				<h4>Changes from the “Selectors and States” Note</h4>

				<p>
					This document has been derived from the “Selectors and States”&nbsp;[[selectors-states]] Working Group Note, published by the Web Annotation Working Group. 
					That Note is based on the formal specification and the semantics of a separate W3C Recommendation, namely the Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[annotation-model]], where it is used to select targets of annotations. 
					This documents introduces some changes as follows. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>Editorial Changes</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All references to RDF and JSON-LD have been removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						The reference to EPUBCFI in the definition for <a href="#FragmentSelector_def">Fragment Selectors</a> have been removed (but new informative reference has been added to section describing how to <a href="#ErsFragmentId_def">serialize Embedded Resource Selectors as fragment identifiers</a>).
					</li>
					<li>
						References to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/#dfn-class" class="externalDFN">Classes</a> (which, semantically, refer to RDF Classes) have been removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						The term <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/#specific-resources" class="externalDFN">“Specific Resource”</a> has been changed to <a>Locator</a>. (This is just an alias to “Specific Resource”, hence does not change the original semantics.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Some of the examples have been changed.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Non-editorial Changes</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The <a href="#locators"><code>scope</code> relationship</a> has been re-introduced. (This relationship is part of the “Web Annotation Data Model”&nbsp;[[annotation-model]] but was not retained in the “Selectors and States”&nbsp;[[selectors-states]] Note.)
					</li>

					<li>
						Three new Selectors have been added, namely
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#EmbeddedResourceSelector_def">Embedded Resource Selectors</a> can be used to select a full resource, with its a, from a collection of resources, also identified with a URL;</li>
							<li><a href="#SpanSelector_def">Span Selectors</a> identify a continuous selection that spans multiple embedded resources in some ordered reading of a collection or group of resources identified with a URL.</li>
							<li><a href="#MultipleResourceSelector_def">Multiple Resource Selectors</a> identify a ordered list of discrete selections, whether within a single resource or spread over multiple embedded resources included in a collection or group of resources identified with a URL
					</li>

					<li>A new kind of specifier, the <a>Position</a> specifier, has been added. Two Position specifier types have been added: 
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#TextStreamPosition_def">Text Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a text stream representation of a resource.</li>
							<li><a href="#ByteStreamPosition_def">Byte Stream Position</a> can be used to define a position within a byte stream representation of a resource.</li>
